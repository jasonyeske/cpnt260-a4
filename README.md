- One technical issue I had with this assignment was trying to get the form over top of the image in a specific location I wanted it. I approached solving this issue by making the image a background image and then centering the call to action.

- For whatever reason, I could get the photo to load on my localhost, but not on the server. I tried 
    - background-image:url(/photos/filename)
    - background-image:url(../photos/filename)
    - background-image:url(filename)
    - background-image:url(photos/filename)
- and it wasnt until I just used the url to the photo that it would load. I'm not sure why it wouldn't load on the server, but using the url to the image was my way to get it to load
